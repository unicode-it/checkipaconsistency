# checkipaconsistency aka cipa
Formerly known as ipa_check_consistency and check_ipa_consistency

## Tool to check consistency across FreeIPA servers
The tool can be used as a standalone consistency checker as well as a
Nagios/Opsview plug-in (check [Nagios section below](#nagios-plug-in-mode) for
more info).

The script was originally written and then developed in BASH (until version
[v1.3.0](https://github.com/peterpakos/checkipaconsistency/tree/v1.3.0)) and
eventually ported to Python in v2.0.0.

It has been tested with multiple FreeIPA 4.2+ deployments across a range of
operating systems.

Requirements:
* FreeIPA 4.2+
* Python 2.7+/3.3+
* Python modules listed in
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/peterpakos/checkipaconsistency/blob/master/requirements.txt)

If you spot any problems or have any improvement ideas then feel free to open
an issue and I will be glad to look into it for you.

## Installation
A recommended way of installing the tool is pip install.

Once installed, a command line tool `cipa` should be available in your system's PATH.

### __WARNING: Never attempt pip install as root!__
__If you do, pip will install new dependencies globally and override existing
packages with potentially incompatible versions. This is particularly important
when installing `cipa` on a machine running FreeIPA server.__

__You should either install the package as an unprivileged user with
`pip install --user` or use a virtual environment.__

### pip install
Please note, in RHEL/CentOS systems you may need to install the following
packages:
```
$ sudo yum install python-devel openldap-devel
```
Debian/Ubuntu systems may require these packages instead:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libsasl2-dev python-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev
```

The tool is available in PyPI and can be installed using pip:
```
$ pip install --user checkipaconsistency
$ cipa --help
```

### Manual install
Run the following command to install required Python modules:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/peterpakos/checkipaconsistency.git
$ cd checkipaconsistency
$ pip install --user -r requirements.txt
$ ./cipa --help
```

## Configuration
By default, the tool reads its configuration from
`~/.config/checkipaconsistency` file (the location can be overridden by setting
environment variable `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). If the config file (or directory) does
not exist then it will be automatically created and populated with sample
config upon the next run. Alternatively, you can specify all required options
directly from the command line.

## Help
```
$ cipa --help

## Debug mode
If you experience any problems with the tool, try running it in debug mode:
```
$ cipa --debug
2017-12-22 20:05:04,494 [main] DEBUG Namespace(binddn=None, bindpw=None, critical=2, debug=True, disable_border=False, disable_header=False, domain=None, hosts=None, log_file=None, nagios_check=None, quiet=False, warning=1)
2017-12-22 20:05:04,494 [main] DEBUG Initialising...
2017-12-22 20:05:04,494 [main] DEBUG Config file not found at /Users/peter/.config/checkipaconsistency
2017-12-22 20:05:04,494 [main] INFO Initial config saved to /Users/peter/.config/checkipaconsistency - PLEASE EDIT IT!
2017-12-22 20:05:04,495 [main] CRITICAL IPA domain not set
```
For more verbosity use `--debug --verbose` arguments.

## Nagios plug-in mode
The tool can be easily transformed into a Nagios/Opsview check:
```
$ pip install checkipaconsistency
$ su - nagios
$ vim ~/.config/checkipaconsistency
$ ln -s `which cipa` /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_ipa_consistency
```

Perform all checks using default warning/critical thresholds:
```
$ /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_ipa_consistency -n all
OK - 15/15 checks passed
```

Perform specific check with custom alerting thresholds:
```
$ /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_ipa_consistency -n users -w 2 -c3
OK - Active Users
```
## Prometheus plug-in mode
The tool can be used to generate a Prometheus compatible textfile ipa.prom, to collect with the node_extractor:
The default folder for the node_extractor is /var/lib/node_extractor/ change it in the config file if needed

Perform all checks :
```
$ cipa -p 
```

Perform specific check and write out textfile ipa.prom:
```
$ cipa -p users
```

### LDAP Conflicts
Normally conflicting changes between replicas are resolved automatically (the
most recent change takes precedence).
However, there are cases where manual intervention is required. If you see LDAP
conflicts in the output of this script,
you need to find the conflicting entries and decide which of them should be
preserved/deleted.

More information on solving common replication conflicts can be found
[here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_directory_server/10/html/administration_guide/managing_replication-solving_common_replication_conflicts).
